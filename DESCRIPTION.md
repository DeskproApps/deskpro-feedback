### Feedback App

​
Have a say in the future of your helpdesk product. The Deskpro Feedback App enables you to give your opinion on where our latest designs and features are going.
​
**Description**
​
The app will give you a preview of a potential new feature or UI update for Deskpro, it will explain how it works, and why we're creating it.
​
You will be able to provide us with feedback by clicking on the **Provide Feedback** button under each post, where you can share your opinion about the idea, letting us know if you think it will be useful or how we could adapt it to make it even better, and help us to iterate to the best outcome for everyone.
​
When you're submitting feedback you will also have the option over whether you want to make your comments public on our [Feedback Community Forum](https://support.deskpro.com/en-US/community/browse/active-1,2,3,9,10/type-9/date-desc/view-list/viewmode-compact).
